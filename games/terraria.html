            <h1>TERRARIAAAAA</h1>
            <p>I am here to say this is the best sandbox game ever created.<br> Terraria,
                created by Re-Logic, is an indie game that will make you go into
                spiralling inside a wiki that has yet to be updated. You'll get to do
                many things, such as build box-houses, exploring the world, going to hell 
                or kill god.
                After 220+ hours of gameplay and beating it in master mode, I think
                I have a lot to say about this precious thing. So, let's beging with my Terraria
                TED Talk.

            <h2>The minecraft 'clone'</h2>
            <p>Many people call Terraria the 'Minecraft clone'. However, they could
                not be anymore wrong about this. <br>
                Let's start with the fact that Terraria is <strong>older</strong> than
                Minecraft. Even if it's for just a few months.
